# TRACE System Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through setting up the TRACE integration system from scratch. The system consists of multiple microservices that work together to provide a complete tracing and verification platform.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the setup, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Docker** - Container runtime for building and running services
- **Minikube** or **Kind** - Local Kubernetes cluster
- **kubectl** - Kubernetes command-line tool
- **Helm** - Kubernetes package manager
- **Git** - Version control system
- **Bash shell** - For running setup scripts

## Initial System Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the integration repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/TRACE.git
cd TRACE
```

### 2. Configure Git Subtree Remotes

The TRACE system uses Git subtrees to integrate multiple service repositories. Set up the remote repositories for all services:

```bash
# Add all service repositories as remotes
git remote add sensor-data-service https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/sensor-data-service.git
git remote add sensor-key-registry https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/sensor-key-registry.git
git remote add camunda-service https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/camunda-service.git
git remote add proving-service https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/proving-service.git
git remote add verifier-service https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/verifier.git
git remote add pcf-registry https://github.com/ACP-PCVCF/pcf-registry.git
```

Verify the remotes are configured correctly:
```bash
git remote -v
```

### 3. Start the Cluster and Install Camunda

Choose either Minikube or Kind for your local Kubernetes cluster and run the appropriate setup script:

**For Minikube:**
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/minikube/setup.sh
./scripts/minikube/setup.sh
```

**For Kind:**
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/kind/setup.sh
./scripts/kind/setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Start your Kubernetes cluster
- Install Camunda Platform
- Deploy all TRACE services
- Configure necessary networking

### 4. Configure Port Forwarding

After the cluster is running, you need to set up port forwarding to access the services from your local machine.

#### Camunda Gateway (Required for Modeler)

Forward the Zeebe gateway port to connect Camunda Modeler:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-zeebe-gateway 26500:26500 -n proving-system
```

**Important:** Keep this terminal session open while working with Camunda Modeler.

#### Camunda Operate (Process Management)

Forward the Camunda Operate service to view and manage process instances:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/camunda-operate 8081:80 -n proving-system
```

Access Camunda Operate at: http://localhost:8081
- Username: `demo`
- Password: `demo`

## BPMN Model Deployment

### 1. Configure Camunda Modeler

In the Camunda Modeler application:

1. Open your BPMN files for e.g.:
   - `origin.bpmn`
   - `tsp.bpmn`
   - `Case_1 Kopie.bpmn`
   - `Case_2 Kopie.bpmn`
   - `Case_3 Kopie.bpmn`

2. Select **Camunda 8 â†’ Self-Managed**

3. Configure connection settings:
   - **Zeebe Gateway Address:** `localhost:26500`
   - **Authentication:** None

### 2. Deploy and Start Processes

1. Click **Deploy Current Diagram** in Camunda Modeler
2. Start the process in Camunda Modeler
3. Monitor progress in Camunda Operate (http://localhost:8081/operate)

## Verification and Monitoring

### Check Service Status

Verify all services are running correctly:

```bash
# Check pods in proving-system namespace
kubectl get pods -n proving-system

# Check pods in verifier-system namespace
kubectl get pods -n verifier-system
```

### Monitor Service Logs

View logs for individual services:

```bash
# Camunda service logs
kubectl logs deployment/camunda-service -n proving-system

# Sensor data service logs
kubectl logs deployment/sensor-data-service -n proving-system

# Proving service logs
kubectl logs deployment/proving-service -n proving-system

# PCF registry service logs
kubectl logs deployment/pcf-registry-service -n proving-system

# Verifier service logs
kubectl logs deployment/verifier-service -n verifier-system
```

## System Architecture Overview

The TRACE system consists of the following main components:

- **Camunda Service** - Workflow orchestration and process management
- **Sensor Data Service** - Handles sensor data collection and processing
- **Sensor Key Registry** - Manages sensor authentication keys
- **Proving Service** - Manages cryptographic proofs and verification
- **Verifier Service** - Independent verification of proofs and claims
- **PCF Registry** - Product Carbon Footprint registry we use to upload and download proofs

## Next Steps

Once your system is set up and running:

1. Explore the Camunda Operate interface to understand process flows
2. Review the individual service documentation for advanced configuration
3. Set up monitoring and logging for production use
